#H1 Hi there, I am BriannaðŸ‘‹
  ##H2 I am in school to get my Bachelor's degree in Graphic Information Techonology (UX Design). After graduation, I plan to work as a User Experience Designer and be a wonderful addition to my next team. Coding is new to me, but it has been a blast to learn about it all. I would love to continue learning more about it to help me reach my end goals. Aside from school, I love to play softball in my free time and keep my body and mind moving!
